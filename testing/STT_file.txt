 Hey, are you free to catch up later today? Yeah, I think so. What time are you thinking? Maybe around five, I just have a couple of things to finish up before then. Five works for me. Where do you want to meet? How about that new coffee shop on Main Street? I heard they have great pastries. It sounds good to me. I've been wanting to try their cappuccino. Nice. So, how's work been? Oh, you know, busy as always. We're in the middle of a big project right now. Lots of late nights. That sounds intense. What's the project about? It's a new app we're developing for managing team tasks. It's supposed to help streamline communication and project management. That sounds really useful. I could definitely use something like that at my job.
