Hey team, thanks for jumping on this call again.

No problem, John. How’s it going?

Pretty good, Emma. How about you, Matt?

I’m doing well. Ready to tackle the day. What’s on the agenda today, John?

I wanted to check in on a few things from yesterday. Emma, did you get a chance to look over the specs Matt sent?

Yes, I did. Everything looks good. I’ve started drafting some initial designs. I’ll send them over later today for feedback.

That’s great to hear. Matt, how’s your team doing with the setup for the beta environment?

We’re making good progress. We should have it ready by the end of the week. I’ll let you know if we run into any issues.

Perfect. Emma, do you need anything else to keep moving forward?

Actually, I had a question about the timeline you shared. Are we still aiming to have a prototype ready in two weeks?

Yes, that’s the goal. Do you think that’s feasible?

I think so. As long as we stay on track and get timely feedback, we should be able to meet that deadline.

I agree. Matt, how’s your team’s workload? Are you confident we can hit that two-week mark?

We’re good. We’ve allocated enough resources to this project, so barring any unforeseen issues, we should be fine.

Awesome. I also wanted to discuss the user testing phase again. Emma, have you started thinking about the beta tester recruitment?

Yes, I’ve drafted an email to our existing customer base. I’ll send it out tomorrow. I’m aiming to get about 20 testers initially.

That sounds like a solid plan. Matt, anything else we need to consider for the beta environment?

Just one thing. We should probably set up a feedback loop so that any issues reported by the beta testers get to us quickly. I’ll work on setting that up.

Good idea. Emma, can you coordinate with Matt on that?

Of course. We’ll make sure everything’s in place before we go live.

Great. Is there anything else we need to cover today?

I think we’re good. Just a reminder, I’ll be sending out the initial designs later today for your feedback.

And I’ll update you both once the beta environment is ready.

Sounds like we’re all set. Thanks for the updates, everyone. Let’s keep this momentum going.

Absolutely. Thanks for the coordination, John.

No problem. Talk to you both later.

Bye, John. Bye, Matt.

Talk to you later, John. Bye, Emma.
