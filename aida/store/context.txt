What if there are thousands of alien empires in the Milky Way, each spanning a few to maybe tens of star systems, cheating, trading, sometimes shooting or ignoring each other politely? And if so, why is nobody visiting us? While the Milky Way is ancient and gigantic, even traveling at 10% the speed of light, any civilization could take over the whole galaxy within a million years. But we haven't seen anybody yet, so it seems we're alone in the Milky Way. But this idea is built on a lot of assumptions. Usually, when scientists speculate where all the alien civilizations are, they assume technology will progress to a point where colonizing all of space becomes kind of easy. But what if we're thinking about this the wrong way? What if the universe is full of life, but...

AIDA: From our previous conversations, you've speculated about the possibility of thousands of alien empires existing in the Milky Way, each potentially spanning multiple star systems. You've posited that these civilizations might engage in a mix of cheating, trading, and non-aggression. 

You also raised the intriguing question of why we have yet to encounter any visitors from these civilizations, despite the vastness and age of the Milky Way. Furthermore, you've discussed the assumptions scientists make regarding the progression of technology, which might eventually allow civilizations to colonize space easily. If you'd like to explore this topic further or discuss any specific aspects, feel free to let me know!Date: 2024-08-19
User: The discussion you just heard about aliens was a YouTube video that was not me speaking. I'd just like you to remember that for future reference. Well, right now I am at Madar currently, and an hour ago I had a meeting with Abdullah Khamis, who is the business development manager at Madar. We had a meeting about a presentation, an executive summary actually, which has to be sent to Asmo, A-S-M-O. This company, we met them a couple of weeks ago. The discussions were really fruitful. I went over there as a business analyst again, and my role at the meeting was mainly to, you know, take notes, infer their challenges, and any other things like that. After the meeting, I was tasked with writing the technical proposal and also the executive summary for the Asmo company. My meeting with Abdullah Khamis, however, that was about improvements in the executive summary, like the content. He mentioned a couple of things, like for example, he said that the screenshots which we're presenting on the document, they could be better, they could be improved. In addition to that, he also mentioned that the invoices, which the invoice module basically, we could present that in a better fashion. In the introduction, he said that we can show the different authorities by which MADAR is certified, like for example, the transport government authority, the customs authority, and the communications authority. So, yeah, that was mainly, I think, everything we talked about in the meeting with Abdullah Khamis.
